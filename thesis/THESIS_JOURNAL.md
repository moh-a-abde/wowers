# WOWERS Thesis Journal

Running log of thesis-writing sessions. One entry per work package drafted. This mirrors
`WOWERS_PROJECT_JOURNAL.md` but tracks the *paper*, not the code.

---

## ⚠️ INSTRUCTION FOR AI AGENTS — READ THIS FIRST

**RULE 0 — ONBOARD BEFORE WRITING.** Before drafting any part of the thesis, complete the
4-step onboarding at the top of `thesis/THESIS_BREAKDOWN.md` (read the project journal, skim
the repo, read `thesis/thesis_format_prompt.md`, read the breakdown). Do not write thesis
prose until you have done this.

**RULE 1 — ONE WORK PACKAGE PER SESSION.** Draft exactly one work package (e.g. `T1`, `M1`,
`J1`) from `THESIS_BREAKDOWN.md`. Do not batch multiple parts or write the whole thesis in
one pass. When that one part is done, stop.

**RULE 2 — LOG WHAT YOU WROTE.** At the end of every session where a work package was
drafted or revised, append a new entry to the Session Log at the bottom of this file, using
the exact structure below. Also update the checkbox and §7 status row for that work package
in `THESIS_BREAKDOWN.md`.

**RULE 3 — IDENTIFY THE AUTHOR.** Tag every session title with the owner of the work package
— `— Tom` for Track T packages, `— Mohamed` for Track M packages, `— Joint` for Track J
packages. If unsure who is at the keyboard, ask before logging.

**RULE 4 — NEVER REWRITE A PAST ENTRY.** Previous session entries are permanent records. Do
not modify, reformat, or delete them. If something needs correcting, note it in the NEW
entry only.

**RULE 5 — ONLY ADD TO THE BOTTOM.** New entries go at the very bottom of the Session Log,
below all previous entries.

### Session entry structure

```
### Session: YYYY-MM-DD — <WP id> <section name> — <Tom|Mohamed|Joint>

**Work package:** <e.g. T1 · Ch2 Background & Prior Work>

**What was drafted:**
- [what section(s) now have a first draft, and roughly how many words]

**Source artifacts used:**
- [every repo file, report, dataset, or external source the draft draws on]

**Figures / tables produced or specified:**
- [figure/table placeholders inserted, per the format's [FIGURE N] convention]

**Open items / follow-ups:**
- [anything left as TODO, e.g. missing citation, number to confirm, figure to build]

**Breakdown updated:**
- [confirm the §3 checkbox and §7 status row were ticked]

**Next work package suggested:**
- [which WP should be drafted next, per the §6 order]
```

## Section 0 baseline numbers (must be identical everywhere in the thesis)

Any draft that cites these must match exactly (P2-SEED re-baseline):

- POTWs screened: **17,148** → project-viable: **1,138**
- Physics ceiling: **409.2 GWh/yr** (409.17 GWh) · calibrated band: **119–281 GWh/yr**
- Portfolio NPV: **$310.1M** · CapEx: **$211.3M** · savings: **$41.2M/yr** · median payback:
  **9.8 yr**
- Exclusion funnel: 17,148 → 5,464 flow-valid → 4,860 head-valid → 3,778 scored → 1,138 viable

### Session: 2026-07-23 — T1 Ch2 Background & Prior Work — Tom

**Work package:** T1 · Ch2 Background & Prior Work

**What was drafted:**
- Full first draft of Chapter 2 in `thesis/thesis_tom.tex` (~2,280 words): opening + §§2.1–2.4
- §2.1 six numbered recovery limitations (unmeasured head, DMR corruption, river-CF misapplication, O&M/debris, site-by-site origination, economic opacity) each with quantified impact + citation
- §2.2 LucidPipe Portland (CF 0.628), Rentricity, CINK — what current practice catches vs misses
- §2.3 first-principles primer \(P=\eta\rho g Q H\), ECHO/ICIS + DMR + 3DEP + EHA scope
- §2.4 lit peak comparing DOE Hydropower Vision / ORNL NSD, HydroSource EHA CF, ORNL conduit/BCM, and WOWERS
- Seeded 14 IEEE-style `\bibitem`s used by Ch2 (J5 will still merge Track M/Joint refs later)

**Source artifacts used:**
- `WOWERS_PROJECT_JOURNAL.md` (turbine manufacturer research; LucidPipe / Rentricity / CINK; ORNL/HydroSource notes)
- `ENERGY_CONSUMPTION_RESEARCH_PLAN.md`, `ENERGY_CONSUMPTION_SOURCES.md` (EPRI 30.2 TWh, kWh/MG bands, offset sanity)
- `CF_CALIBRATION_REPORT.md` §§4–6 (WWTP vs river CF; LucidPipe anchor; 119–281 GWh band)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (pipeline/data sources overview)
- `thesis/thesis_format_prompt.md` §5 Ch2 rules (voice, numbered faults, lit density)

**Figures / tables produced or specified:**
- Table `\ref{tab:prior_work}` — scale/prior-work comparison (DOE Vision, EHA CF, ORNL conduit/BCM, WOWERS)
- Equation `\eqref{eq:hydro}` — \(P=\eta\rho g Q H\)
- No new figures this WP (figure inventory items are later Track T packages)

**Open items / follow-ups:**
- Several web/vendor citations (`lucidpipe`, `rentricity`, `cink`, `osti3002705`) need stronger primary PDFs / DOIs before final stitch (J5)
- ORNL national conduit potential PDF (Pub176069) not opened from disk this session — table cites TM-2014/525 + OSTI cost tables; may add the conduit-potential report as a fifth row later
- Confirm MONTH_YEAR / School of Engineering naming still outstanding (Section 0)

**Breakdown updated:**
- §3 T1 checkbox → `[x]`; §7 T1 status → ☑

**Next work package suggested:**
- T2 · Ch4.1 System Overview + Ch4.2 Data Acquisition (~1,600 w)
